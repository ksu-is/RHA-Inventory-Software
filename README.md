# RHA-Inventory-Software
Team: Nejra Lilic and Jonnathan Palacios

We are creating a code to automate the recording of inventory count data for Reliable Heating and Air. 
We will be using Python as well as a Raspberry Pi.

On a yearly average millions of dollars are spent on inventory, and it is a process that RHA needs to improve. 
That is why we believe Python could be used to help automate recording of all the transactions done on a day to day basis 
through the warehouse. Inventory counts for audits are projects that Jonnathan has done before, but it has always been very 
manual with processes could be automated. Our end goal with this project is to automate most of the tasks done 
before by manual data entry and have the inventory count data go from the scan guns to a storage device (raspberry pi) linked 
through Bluetooth to the database.

We hope that this inventory software will be used for internal audits at Reliable Heating and Air.
